In an effort to once and for all destroy my constant errors
in using the wrong word for the wrong thing, here is the definition
of everything!

Definition of Terms:
Note that all "has a" relationships described in here are abstract and
may not be directly represented in the actual data structures.

VMM 
	Virtual Memory Manager

Primary Memory 
	RAM (aka main memory)

Secondary Memory 
	Disk (aka backing store)

frame 
	a fixed length block of main memory.
	This is always at the same memory address
	in main memory

frame number
	specifies a specific frame. This can be used as
	a location since a frame is a segment of memory
	not data.

page 
	a fixed length block of data that may be
	in secondary memory or copied into a frame in
	main memory.

page number
	identifier which specifies a page of data which may
	reside in main memory or secondary memory.

	QUESTION: Is this page number stored as data in a page, or
	does it correspond to a location in secondary memory?

	TENTATIVE ANSWER: Page n corresponds to the nth block of data in
	secondary memory meaning it can be used as an idex when retrieving data from
	secondary memory. In other words, pages are always stored 
	consecutively in order of the page number in secondary memory.

page table
	a special page which holds a mapping of page numbers to frame numbers
	in main memory
