2 Replacement Policies

FIFO

LRU (Least Recently Used)

Overall idea. The entry that has been used the longest time ago gets replaced.


So I'm guessing you maintain an order of usage list and update the list everytime you use something by bringing it to the front
This would mean we always get rid of the last element in the list when we need to perform a replacement... yup

Let's use a linked list for this

template <typename T>
class LinkedList {
public:



private:
	struct Node {
		T element_;
		Node* next_;
	}

	Node* front_;
	Node* end_;



};
